The original plan for this project was to allow Spotify users to log in with their Spotify account. Users would be able create and edit playlists, with a lot more functionality than Spotify provides OOTB. Unfortunately, Spotify's Developer API and Dashboard are extremely volatile, with limited support from Spotify. This project had to subsequently be archived, but the tailwind styles and next.js layout learning experiences were invaluable.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
